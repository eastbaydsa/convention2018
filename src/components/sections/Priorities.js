              Ratifying a Priorities Resolution is in many respects our most important task at this
              upcoming Convention. This document is a crucial mechanism of democratic
              accountability—it's the most direct way that we as members have of letting our
              incoming Steering Committee know how we want them to approach the bulk of our
              chapter's work.
            </P>

                A Priorities Resolution is a holistic, 1000-word (maximum) document that briefly
                lays out an analysis of the political landscape and identifies several "priority
                work areas" that the Resolution submitters think we should devote the bulk of our
                time and attention to in the upcoming year.
              </Strong>
            </P>

            <P>
              Those "priority work areas" will name a political or organizational priority (e.g.
              "Labor," "Political Education," etc.) and then identify a strategy for working towards
              that goal, tactics that we might engage in, and coalition partners we want to
              collaborate with.
            </P>
            <H3>Submission, Feedback, and Amendment Process</H3>
            <P>
              Any member can submit a Priorities Resolution, provided the resolution
              garners <Underline>at least 20 signatures</Underline> of co-sponsors who are EBDSA
              members in good standing. No member can co-sponsor more than one priorities resolution.
            </P>
            <P>

              We encourage any member to offer feedback to the submitters of draft Priorities Resolutions!
              Please do so using <Strong><Link href="https://goo.gl/forms/2fWt52G80feTR6j33">
              this feedback form</Link></Strong>. Feedback is open between April 4 and April 9.
            </P>
            <P>
              The submitters of the draft Priorities Resolutions will be free to incorporate member
              feedback and submit their finalized Priorities Resolution by <Strong>April 14</Strong>.
            </P>
            <P>
              The <Strong>Convention Agenda</Strong>—with Steering Committee candidate statements
              and the finalized versions of all submitted Priorities Resolutions, <Strong>will go
              out to members on April 16</Strong>.
            </P>
            <P>
              At the Convention (<Strong>April 29</Strong>), members will have an open discussion on
              all of the different submitted Priorities Resolutions, and then decide by majority which
              Resolution will serve as the "base" resolution. That majority "base" Resolution will
              then be open to member amendments from the floor of the Convention.
            </P>
            <P>
              After the period of floor amendments, the Convention will vote with a majority
              threshold whether to adopt the Resolution as amended.
            </P>
            <P>
              In several other large DSA chapters, the "base" Priorities Resolution is drafted by
              the Steering Committee and then open to member amendment. We think that the process
              we've designed will enable East Bay DSA members to hear from a variety of differing
              political perspectives on the future of this organization, and then be empowered on
              the floor of the Convention to amend whichever "base" Resolution gains a majority.

            <Strong>Resolutions:</Strong> Per our normal General Meeting
            protocols, an agenda with all relevant resolutions will be
            circulated to membership at least two weeks in advance of the
            meeting.

            <Strong>Motivation and Q&amp;A:</Strong> Each resolution and
            proposal will be motivated by one of its drafters, and there will be
            a short time agendized for clarifying questions and answers.
          </OLI>
          <OLI>
            <Strong>Motions:</Strong> Procedural motions will be taken through

            the agenda. The Convention Organizing Working Group will agendize as
            many amendments as feasible. In the event of too many amendments
            being submitted, the COWG will prioritize agendizing amendments
            based on political substantiveness and minimal redundancy. There
            will be no floor amendments (or amendments to amendments) allowed
            during the meeting.

            Consent Agenda straw poll circulated to the Chapter Membership. The
            Consent Agenda will be passed by a simple majority. Members will not
            be allowed to pull items from the Consent Agenda from the floor.
